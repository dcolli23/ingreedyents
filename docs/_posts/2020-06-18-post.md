Since my last post was discussing the REST API concepts I would need to actually obtain the ingredient/nutrient information, I thought it would be fitting to update the blog with my first success of implementing those concepts in a GUI!

The GUI is made using Qt5 and I've found it pretty great to work with. I especially enjoy the design interface. I've only ever worked with Tkinter in Python for GUI design and it was entirely code-driven. It feels good to have a GUI to design things and give you an idea of the wide set of options that are available to you.
